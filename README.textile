tekErr is a simple lua error manager.  When an error is caught it will blink a small minimap icon to inform you.  Clicking the icon opens a panel listing all errors.  Clicking an error shows a full stack trace, handy to copy/paste into a bug report.

You can also access the panel via an "LDB launcher":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1/wikis or by typing @/err@ or @/tekerr@
